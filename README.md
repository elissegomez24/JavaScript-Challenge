# Employee Payroll Tracker README 

This is a simple web application for tracking employee payroll. It allows users to add employees, display their information in a table, calculate the average salary, and select a random employee.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the "Add Employees" button to start tracking employee data. Follow the prompts to enter each employee's first name, last name, and salary.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for collecting employee data and displaying it on the web page.

## How It Works

- When the "Add Employees" button is clicked, users are prompted to enter employee information.
- After entering employee data, the application calculates and displays the average salary of all employees.
- It then sorts the employee list by last name and displays it in a table on the web page.
- Finally, it selects and displays a random employee from the list.

## Requirements

This application has no web browser requirements. It only requires a modern web browser to run.
